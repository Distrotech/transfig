===============================================================================
Version 3.2
===============================================================================

Patchlevel 5e (August 2013)

BUGS FIXED:
	o HTML map output was limited to 100 links.
	  Fix by Jan van Dijk
	o Updated for compatibility to PNG 1.5
	  From Matthias Scheler
	o Was adding "showpage" command when producing bitmap formats from intermediate EPS.
	  This produced "illegal" PNG and JPEG files with extra, blank image.
	o Maximum width of included image in PS/EPS output increased from 8192 to 16384
	o Precision of some PIC objects increased from %.2f to %.3f
	o Double close of output file when ghostscript fails. Original bug report from
	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/728825

-------------------------------------
Patchlevel 5d (July 23, 2010)

BUGS FIXED:
	o reduces some compilation warnings (fix from Debian)
	o made PostScript output DSC 3.0 compliant to work with CUPS 
	  patch from Ian Dall (see https://bugzilla.redhat.com/558380)
	o Changed STOCK_LAST from 17 to 19 in fig2dev/dev/genemf.c
	o Questionable copy of one data type to another in genemf.c
	o Uninitialized linew_spec in genepic.c
	o Changed definition of command for short slanted lines in genlatex.c

	o Option for debug comments in GBX output is "yes" or "no", not "on" or "off"
	o Added help (-h)  info for GBX output
	o In version 1.4 of the PNG library dither was removed so fig2dev now uses
	  quantize when importing PNG images with palettes
	o put_msg was declared twice (fig2dev/dev/genemf.c)
	o Added xlink namespace for images in SVG export
	o SVG output for imported images didn't form href link properly
	o PIC floating point numbers were only 2 decimal places - now 3 (Debian bug #611948)
	  Fix thanks to Roger Leigh (Debian Project)
	o PIC output text had leading blanks (Debian bug #611977)
	  Fix thanks to Roger Leigh (Debian Project)
	o LaTeX commands for small and tiny dots missing "." (e.g. \small.)
	  from Thomas Loimer

NEW FEATURES:
	o New PSTricks driver from Gene Ressler (see man fig2dev for info)

-------------------------------------
Patchlevel 5c (Jan 4, 2010)

BUGS FIXED:
	o transfig command was hardwired for "tex" for "make all" directive and
	  removing files with "make clean" directive in creating Makefile

-------------------------------------
Patchlevel 5b (Jun 2, 2009)

NEW FEATURES:
	o -a option added to PostScript and PICTeX languages to NOT include user's
	  login name in output
	o Gerber (RS-247-X for CAD drawings for printed circuits) export language from Edward Grace

-------------------------------------
Patchlevel 5a (Jun 1, 2009)

NEW FEATURES:
	o 22 new arrowhead types
	o HTML map now produces reference to .png file instead of .gif

BUGS FIXED:
	o CreationDate in pictex output was either wrong or caused segfault
	o bugs fixed in SVG Driver:
	  - blue component of shaded colors was always zero
	  - line protruding beyond arrowhead on long arrows
	  - wrong position of back arrowhead on double-headed arrows
	  - fill patterns either missing or using incorrect linewidth
	  - lowercase greek phi did not match its X11 counterpart
	  from Martin Kroeker
	o dubious printf(j++,j++) in MP driver
	o missing #includes in MP driver
	o added !defined(__FreeBSD) to fig2dev.h def for sys_nerr and errno
	  From Eric Scott
	o added -quiet options to giftopnm and ppmtopcs in reading GIF files
	  From Eric Scott
	o Typo in LaTeX driver when generating arc-box. "iut" should be "put"
	o extraneous stroke:black in svg header removed along with stroke color
	  for text, since the text fill color does the whole job
	o fig2dev produces more correctly structured PostScript.  Files get printed via
	  CUPS on PostScript printers.  When viewing a .ps-file in gv you can go to the
	  last page and back and to the last page again without getting PostScript errors.
	  From Ronald Lembcke
	o Renamed the macro \SetFigFont to \SetFigFontNFSS if NFSS is #defined to alleviate
	  some problems. From Roland Rosenfeld.

	  from Martin Kroeker
	o EMF driver would crash when fed stdin
	  from Martin Kroeker
	o Unhandled case for linetypes in latex driver
	o CUPS didn't like the order of some of the Postscript header
	  from Ian Dall

-------------------------------------
Patchlevel 5-alpha7 (Oct, 27, 2005)

NEW FEATURES
	o Updated SVG driver from Martin Kroeker was missing from alpha6
	o Another SVG update: Use a font-family list of "Times,Symbol" for symbol
	  characters - the Times fontface does not contain all elements of the
	  Symbol font on all platforms
	
BUGS FIXED:
	o Typo in font name (was cmit10, should be cmti10) in MetaPost driver
	  This bug fix was omitted from alpha6

Patchlevel 5-alpha6 (Oct, 12, 2005)

NEW FEATURES:
	o Added -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress option to ghostscript when generating
	  PDF output to improve quality of bitmap graphics
	o Fill patterns now use PostScript Level 2 built-in pattern commands
	  for Postscript/EPS/PDF and bitmap output
	  From Konstantin Shemyak
	o Updated SVG driver from Martin Kroeker
	o New -K option to size bounding box to whole figure when exporting
	  only certain depths
	  From Dirk Osswald

BUGS FIXED:
	o Typo in font name (was cmit10, should be cmti10) in MetaPost driver
	o When all texts were "special" (LaTeX coded) in a figure, ISO
	  characters weren't encoded in straight PS and PDF output
	o Bug in radius for circles in SVG driver (dev/gensvg.c)
	o fig2dev.man was missing many papersize options
	o Double fclose() in bitmap driver

-------------------------------------
Patchlevel 5-alpha5 (April, 26, 2004)

NEW FEATURES:
	o Raster picture support added to SVG driver. (In SVG, this translates
	  to a link to the image file plus rotation/scaling information. 
	  While 'conformant' SVG viewers need only support PNG and JPEG, there
	  is no a filetype test, as there is no limit on supported formats
	  in the standard, and e.g. Batik is able to display XBM and GIF in
	  addition.  Added code for rounded boxes (polyline subtype 4).
	  Added code for boxes, explicit support for polygons.  Added
	  xml-space:preserve qualifier on texts to preserve whitespace. Rewrote
	  fill pattern handling to generate patterns as needed - adding support
	  for penwidth and color.  Corrected tiling of all shingle patterns and
	  reversal of horizontal shingles.
	  From Martin Kroeker
	o Better arrowheads in SVG driver.  Corrected font family selection.
	  Corrected (and simplified) calculation of white-tinted fill colors
	  (and removed the HSV/RGB conversion code).
	  From Justus Piater

BUGS FIXED:
	o Typo in LATEX_AND_XFIG file. Text should be: 
	  \convertMPtoPDF{foo.0}{1}{1}
	  It was missing parameters {1}{1}
	o Depth filter option -D was parsing range (e.g. 40:80) incorrectly
	  Fix from Justus Piater
	o C++ style comments "//" changed to "/* */" in genmp.c
	o Integer overflow in computing some spline steps
	o \pagestyle{empty} added for epic/eepic driver so it doesn't produce
	  unnecessary page number when LaTeXing

---------------------------------
Patchlevel 5-alpha4 (Feb 19, 2004)

NEW FEATURES
	o Many SVG driver enhancements from Martin Kroeker
	  (martin@ruby.chemie.uni-freiburg.de)
	o New features in EMF driver from ITOH Yasufumi:
	    support for locale text (if iconv() is available),
	    arc box, open arc, rotated ellipse, picture,
	    dash-triple-dotted line style, and all fill patterns.

BUGS FIXED
	o "cleandir" directive missing from doc/manual/Makefile
	o Added note about requiring dummy argument for -R option
	o SVG driver bug fixes: semicolon missing in CSS properties, multiline
	  string problem, width, height and viewbox attributes now relative to
	  figure bounds instead of pagesize. Fixes from Justus Piater.
	o Font info was put in the pstex file even when there were only special
	  texts.

---------------------------------
Patchlevel 5-alpha3 (Dec 9, 2003)

NEW FEATURES
	o Global option "-Z maxdim" to scale figure so that largest dimension
	  (width or height) is maxdim inches
	o Shapepar driver to generate shaped paragraphs for LaTeX (-L shape)
	  from Christian Gollwitzer
	o I18N support postscript file installation moved to fig2dev/dev
	  directory and installed with InstallNonExecFile (imake directive)
	o options -dAutoFilterColorImages=false and -dColorImageFilter=/FlateEncode
	  added to ghostscript call when exporting to pdf to improve image
	  quality during compression
	o "Epoch" added to rpm spec
	o New HP/GL2 driver from Glenn Burkhardt with paper size selection,
	  offset, centering and orientation options

BUGS FIXED
	o comments about BINDIR added to fig2dev/Imakefile and transfig/Imakefile
	  so user can easily change installation directory of both programs
	o MKDIRHIER used in Imakefile for installing support files instead of mkdir
	o commands like \\small used instead of SetFigFont for thick and thin
	  dots for LaTeX export
	  From Bo Thilde
	o removed typedefs of uint, ushort and ulong from genemf.h because
	  systems should already have those defined
	o SVG driver not mentioned in fig2dev.1 (.man)
	o shortened two fprintf calls in gensvg.c for HP-UX which can't handle
	  long strings
	o If an imported picture path points to some directory which is not the
	  current directory, and there exists a picture file of the same name in
	  the current directory, and the correct file is not compressed, fig2dev
	  would use the file in the current directory because it stripped off
	  the path first.  This was fixed by looking for the uncompressed name
	  first.
	o Color values should be divided by 255, not 256 to produce values from
	  0 to 1.0 in LaTeX, Tk and PostScript drivers, and readpng and readpcx
	  utilities
	o Increased precision of arc angles from %.1f to %.4f in PS/EPS/PDF
	  driver
	o Postscript support files now installed with r/w permissions only (was
	  r/w/x)
	o Metapost (mp) driver now generates all Fig styles of arrowheads
	  From Tim Braun
	o Bug in pic preamble - default font size either 0 or garbage
	o PDF not rotated anymore for landscape mode (similar to eps)
	o fontmag not set when magnification was read from Fig file
	o When there were only LaTeX special texts without backslashes (\) and
	  no other objects in the figure, a bounding box of 0 width was produced
	  for EPS, PS and PSTEX output.
	o Added ZLIBDIR variable in fig2dev/Imakefile to specify zlib directory
	  if different from standard location
	o pstex_t export lacked border option (-b) to align LaTeX text when
	  pstex figure specified border (also fixed in xfig Combined PS/LaTeX)
	o warnings in gentpic.c caused failure of gcc on hppa architecture under
	  Debian
	o cleaned up lots of implicit declarations of functions/procs
	o transfig: the "psfig" language was missing from the list of languages,
	  making things go out of sync past "ps".
	o transfig: "transfig -L pstex" was generating rules for ps not eps
	o slight margin added to text bounds
	o an incorrect printf specification (%d instead of %ld) in gemp.c
	o "#include <varargs.h>" no longer needed (and is unsupported by gcc 3.3)
	o Not a bug, really but a workaround for programs that generate Fig files
	  with arcs that have coincident start and end points with the intent
	  of making a circle (TCM apparently does this).  Without this
	  workaround, such arcs have the same start and end angle, which
	  ghostcript and probably other PostScript interpreters take to mean
	  "don't draw anything".  This fix adds 0.01 degrees to the end angle
	  if it is identical to the start angle.
	o Exporting a file with a picture containing a path with blanks failed
	o Incorrect ISO translation was: 
	      "\\.S", /* latin capital letter S with dot above */
	  Should be:
	      "\\.Z", /* latin capital letter Z with dot above */
	o LaTeX: Correction to the ISO-8859-2 ogonek diacritic mark now uses \k
	  instead of cedilla (\c).  If the macro \k isn't defined in your
	  situation or you don't see the ogonek then define the macro: \def\k#1{\c{#1}}
	  before the \begin{document}.  
	  From Jerzy Sobczyk
	o Bug in user-defined colors when exporting to CGM. If color numbers
	  weren't contiguous, e.g. 32, 34, then it couldn't find color 34.
	o glyphs in the Symbol font that have descenders weren't taken into
	  account when calculating text bounds
	o missing blue and extra brown color in LaTeX driver
	o \smash directive added back to text objects in eepic driver (was removed 
	  in 3.2.4)
	o Quotes in FIG2DEV_LIBDIR definition (fig2dev/Imakefile) interferred when
	  using $DESTDIR
	o Comments not inserted in EMF output anymore (not valid in language)
	o float/int mixup in printf in pic driver for font size caused default
	  font size to be 0
	o bug in hp/gl (ibmgl) driver produced incorrect JCL code to enter HP/GL
	  mode when using -k option
	o point size factor changed from 72.27 to 72 points per inch as specified
	  by HP tech notes
	o change in 3.2.4 which included all "special" (LaTeX) texts in the
	  bounding box that don't have any backslashes ("\") in them failed to
	  take into account inline equations using the "$".  Now those special
	  texts are also excluded from the bounding box calculation.
	o various man page format errors fixed

-----------------------------
Patchlevel 4 (December 2002)

NEW FEATURES
	o SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) driver from Anthony Starks, modified
	  by Brian Smith and greatly enhanced by Martin Kroeker
	o ASCII and Binary (TIFF) preview bitmap options for PostScript and EPS
	  export.  The latter is useful for Microsoft products which require a
	  TIFF preview to display EPS on the screen. Use -A for ASCII preview,
	  use -C for color TIFF or -T for monochrome TIFF preview.  These all
	  require ghostscript to work.  If you don't have ghostscript, the
	  export will continue without a preview.
	o JPEG encoding (DCT) now used for EPS/PostScript output. This greatly
	  reduces the size of the generated PostScript.  Gleaned with permission
	  from jpeg2ps program written by Thomas Merz.
	  As a result of this, the jpeg library is no longer needed, although xfig
	  still needs it for JPEG support.
	o Background (-g) option for tk export honored now
	o Additional JPEG file format (EXIF) added. These usually come from
	  digital cameras.
	o -N Option to convert colors to grayscale on export.
	o -b option for CGM export to produce binary CGM using ralcgm. You must,
	  of course have ralcgm installed on your system to use this.
	o Translations of LATEX.AND.XFIG document into two popular Chinese
	  encodings (GB2312 and Big5).  These are called LATEX.AND.XFIG.zh_CN
	  and LATEX.AND.XFIG.zh_TW respectively.
	  From Mendel Chan
	o The default for multi-page output (PostScript) is to NOT overlap pages
	  now.  This is to allow multiple, independent pages of figures.
	  The -O option has been added to force page overlap, e.g. to cut and
	  paste pages together to make posters (the original use for multipage).
	o Added EMF (Enhanced MetaFile) conversion genemf.c
	  from Mike Schrick (based on the CGM driver from Philippe Bekaert
	o New grid option (-G) to draw grid on page.  Specify minor and/or major
	  tick spacing in one of several units.  For example, "-G .25:1cm" draws
	  a thin, gray line every .25 cm and a thicker gray line every 1 cm.
	  Specifying "-G 1in" draws a thin line every 1 inch.  See man pages for
	  all units.  Fractions may be used, e.g. -G 1/16:1/2in will make a thin
	  line every 1/16 (0.0625) inch and a thick line every 1/2 (0.5) inch.
	  Only implemented in PostScript, EPS, PDF, and bitmap (GIF, JPEG, etc)
	  drivers for now.
	o Perk/Tk driver from Slaven Rezic (rezic@onlineoffice.de)
	o Added options -B and -R to the EPS driver. This enables the user to
	  clip out a region for display in the EPS file. Very convenient when
	  using xfig via pstoedit as a postprocessor of ps files and one wants
	  to maintain the preview of the file in lyx. See the man for additional
	  information.  From Morten S. Nielsen <msn@ipt.dtu.dk>
	o New PostScript DSC directives to specify page size.  Doesn't select
	  tray, which is device dependent, but works better with ghostscript,
	  ghostview and other PostScript interpreters.  
	o fig2dev now includes all "special" (LaTeX) texts that don't have any
	  backslashes ("\") in them in the bounding box.
	o genepic and genpictex drivers updated for I18N (internationalization)
	  From T. Sato
	o Glyphs for Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Slovak and Slovenian
	  are essentially the same as Czech (ISO-Latin 2) so symbolic links are
	  created for those .ps files (hu_HU.ps, pl_PL.ps, ro_RO.ps, sk_SK.ps
	  and sl_SI.ps are linked to cs_CZ.ps)
	o fig2dev prepends any path included in the .fig filename to imported
	  image file paths (only if imported image path isn't already absolute).
	o transfig now reports when it is renaming an existing makefile or TeX
	  macro file to a backup (e.g. Makefile to Makefile~)
	o now uses Thomas Merz' jpeg2ps for imported jpeg files when exporting
	  to PS/EPS.  This is much more compact than the runlength encoding
	  which is used for other bitmaps.  Many thanks to Thomas for his
	  permission to use jpeg2ps.
	o New option for binary CGM export. The ralcgm program is required for
	  this option.  See ftp://ftp.cc.rl.ac.uk/pub/graphics/ralcgm/
	o New -E option to set encoding for pictex, latex, pstex_t and epic
	  text to ISO8859-1 (the default) or ISO8859-2
	o Added "install.all" option to make to install man pages in addition to
	  executables etc.
	o If output file ends in ".fig", fig2dev prints error message to stderr
	  and exits.
	o New encoding option (-E) for ISO-8859-1 or ISO-8859-2 from Tomas Kopal
	o Exporting to tk now supports imported PPM images in addition to GIF
	  and XPM
	o Comments added to EPS and PostScript output so MetaPost can group parts of
	  figure according to depths.  From Klaus Guntermann.
	o New -F, -R and -t options for epic output (do "fig2dev -h" for info).
	  From Gabriel Zachmann.

BUGS FIXED
	o When importing multiple GIF or PCX images, fig2dev would segfault on
	  Linux.  This happened for two reasons: the GIF file was closed and
	  reopened, which would result in a different file structure being
	  closed by the calling routine, and a palette was being allocated for
	  the PCX image and never used.
	o In multi-page mode for PDF export, figure was shifted up too far.
	o The color gold was in the wrong place for LaTeX special text.
	o Various extraneous variables removed
	o In multipage mode (PostScript export), if the figure is smaller than
	  0.1 page, nothing was generated or printed.
	o When exporting to EPS, the multipage flag was not cleared after
	  reading the file (options are set before reading file).
	o Bug in the -D option (export or exclude certain depths) where it
	  wouldn't accept 0 as a depth specifier.
	o Extra "char *c" definition in fig2dev/dev/readeps.c
	o Possible data type problem with result of floor() in readeps.c - now
	  coerced with (int)
	o fig2dev would sometimes emit the "transparentimage" for JPEG images
	  (it's only for GIF with a transparent color)
	o Minor adjustment made in tk driver which fixes problem where objects
	  extend beyond the canvas, when the objects are very far away from the
	  origin (50 inches or more)
	o Line join was not explicitely set to "miter" and line cap was not set
	  to "butt" explicitely at the beginning.  This caused problems if the
	  figure was imported into another figure because settings from
	  importing document were used
	o PNGINC Imakefile variable wasn't used
	o Minimum length (MIN_LEN) for "LaTeX short lines" was calculated
	  incorrectly (was using 13 pixels instead of 13 points as per Lamport)
	  Also, actual length of line was compared instead of horizontal
	  component (or vertical component for vertical lines)
	  Fixed by Jacques Lefrere
	o The lines in three patterns: 45 degrees left, 45 degrees right and
	  45 degrees crosshatch were too close together compared to the xfig
	  (on-screen) version
	o Pagesize may have been one pixel too small when exporting to PDF
	o Text font sizes for latex, pic and tpic output were incorrectly scaled
	  for metric Fig files (their units are points, not inches or cm)
	o Added "&& !defined(__CYGWIN__) && !defined(__DARWIN__)" to declaration
	  of sys_errlist[], errno and sys_nerr.  The __DARWIN__ is for Mac OSX
	  using X.
	o Font size was incorrect for CGM output when exporting Fig 2.x files
	o Bug introduced in 3.2.3d shifted rotated imported pictures
	o Missing % from \end{picture} in generated latex code. This caused bad
	  extra spacing when the generated file is \input into a minipage or a
	  framebox, for instance.
	  Fix from Matthias Koeppe
	o Not really a bug, but the text() proc in fig2dev/dev/gengcm.c was
	  renamed to cgm_text because of a bug in IBM's compiler which turns
	  text() into a .text assembler directive
	o Options (fig2dev -h) incorrectly had "-p name" for pstex options
	  instead of pstex_t
	o Updated language options in transfig to current set in fig2dev
	o Incorrect adjustment of scale and canvas offset for tk and ptk
	  (perl/tk) export
	o In the PIC driver, the macro PICFONTMAG should return int, but was
	  returning double, which then trashed following arguments to fprintf.
	o Extraneous semi-colon (;) after closing brace } and/or empty default
	  case (no trailing semi-colon) causes HP ANSI compiler to complain
	o Moved landscape rotation of page and Y-flip scaling inside
	  %%BeginPageSetup %%EndPageSetup block according to DSC, which says
	  that page orientation code should be there.
	o ANSI style prototype for rgb2luminance did not match proc declaration
	o When a compound object included lines that have arrowheads and large
	  coordinates (>= 100000), an incorrect bounding box was produced.
	  This same bug was in xfig 3.2.3d and earlier.
	o Output file was being closed twice in CGM and PDF driver, causing
	  segfault on some systems.
	o In the eepic driver, the thickness of a line may be incorrect if it a
	  has backward arrowhead of different thickness.

-----------------------------
Patchlevel 3d: (May 29, 2001)

NEW FEATURES

	o MetaPost driver (-L mp or -L mmp) ported from fig2MP by Klaus
	  Guntermann (guntermann@iti.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de).  fig2MP was
	  written by Dane Dwyer (dwyer@geisel.csl.uiuc.edu)
	o Support for importing PNG image files added 
	o Transparent color in imported GIF files now honored
	o You may use "-M -" to send the Makefile output to standard output from
	  TransFig, and "-T -" to send the Texfile to standard output.
	o (The following feature was really added in 3.2.3, but I forgot to update
	  this file): -S option added for smoothing bitmap output.
	o (The following feature was really added in 3.2.3b, but ... you know...):
	  eps added as a language for TransFig
	o Support for Czech font encoding for PostScript (cs_CZ.ps)
	  From Radim Gelner <gelnerr@suse.cz>

BUGS FIXED

	o #ifdef JPEG added in usage message for JPEG options
	o Resolution variable (ppi) needed to be double.  This caused roundoff
	  and overflow errors in several drivers.
	o Comments longer than 200 characters in Fig files caused segfault.
	  Comments may now be of unlimited length.
	o some bitmap files for tk driver had double brackets "{"
	o The CGM driver didn't check if the "from" input was from stdin or a
	  file and segfaulted.
	o Spline objects with trailing blanks (in file) made next object read
	  incorrectly.
	o Bounding box incorrectly counted line thickness in imported picture
	  objects (they don't use the line thickness)
	o The amount to shift a figure to 0,0 was rounded to integer, which
	  caused some figures to be clipped by the bounding box.  This affected
	  eps and bitmap output.
	o The ibmgl driver output NaNs because of a double/int mixup with printf
	o Certain punctuation characters with descenders weren't taken into
	  account for text bounds.
	o An extra page was generated for pdf output.
	o Every object had 0.0000 coordinates when exporting to the MetaFont
	  driver.
	o fig2dev would crash when reading FIG 3.1 files that have splines. The
	  problem was that the "points" component of the spline structure is in
	  a different position than in the line structure, causing arrow_bound
	  to use the wrong data.
	o "%Page:" DSC comment is not generated generated for EPS now
	o Trailing blank in spline object (after control points) caused problem
	  when reading Fig file
	o TransFig didn't check whether Texfile or Makefile could be opened for
	  writing, causing segfault
	o AutoRotatePages now set to None when using ghostscript to export PDF
	o Changed explicit "ln -s" to use $(LN) for making symlinks during
	  install (fig2dev/Imakefile)

------------------------------
Patchlevel 3c  (July 25, 2000)

BUGS FIXED
	o TransFig manual Makefile now calls ../../fig2dev/fig2dev preventing
	  the Catch-22 problem of having to install TransFig before you can
	  compile it 
	o fig2dev/dev/genpdf.c needs "#include <signal.h>" for some systems
	o Added -m 644 to "install" directives in Imakefile to make updates
	  easier in future (no read-only files)
	o LaTeX and pstex_t driver produced bogus \unitlength and \dashbox
	  values
	o File ko_KR.ujis.ps removed because it is not needed

------------------------------
Patchlevel 3b  (July 19, 2000)

N.B. There was no transfig 3.2.3a - I want to keep the release number identical
     to that of the corresponding xfig.

NEW FEATURES
	o X11 Color database ASCII file (/usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt) is now used,
	  removing the need for the dbm_xxx functions.
	o The \special code for colors in genlatex (LaTeX driver) replaced with
	  the \color code to be compatible with pdflatex and not require dvips
	  From Klaus Guntermann (guntermann@iti.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de)
	o PCX image reader now handles 24-bit color which means that TIFF images
	  (which are converted to PCX first) may also be 24-bit

BUGS FIXED
	o Exporting to PDF now sets bounding box to figure bounds instead of page
	o Explicitely sets color to black before importing eps file in case that
	  file doesn't select a color
	o Changed error message in epic driver from "Unknown style" to "Only
	  solid, dashed, and dotted line styles supported by epic(eepic)"
	o Apostrophes (') in text are now escaped in CGM driver
	  from David Billinghurst (David.Billinghurst@riotinto.com.au)
	o One of the header values for TIFF files was incorrect (was "DD",
	  should be "II")
	o -f (font) option wasn't parsed correctly, which caused segfault
	o Bug in handling imported xpm file colors in certain formats
	o Multiple variables with same name in different drivers now declared
	  "static"
	o In multi-page mode, redundant "Page: 1 1" was generated
	o Unnecessary scaling in the pattern definitions removed (pdf/ps/eps
	  drivers)
	o Total page number calculation was incorrect for multi-page PostScript
	  output
	o Toplevel Imakefile referred to "make" instead of "$(MAKE)"
	o Text object read routine had extra variable in scanf
	o Error in calculation of arc arrowhead occluding underlying line; could
	  cause asin domain error
	o Possible error in reading imported GIF colormap
	o calc_arrow() didn't set nboundpts (number of points in bounding box)
	  if line having arrowhead had zero length
	o Bug in Imakefile - jpeglib.h file couldn't be found for JPEG code if
	  USEXPM was not enabled.
	o "Special" LaTeX text not included in bounding box anymore - this had
	  caused positioning problems with the LaTeX special text and figure
	o "hyphen" was misspelled as "hypen" the character encoding for the
	   PostScript (and EPS/PDF) driver.
	o One of the two TIFF file header types was incorrect
	o Segfault when exporting to GIF if Fig file specified "none" for GIF
	  transparency
	o Duplicate JPEG information in fig2dev/Imakefile
	o If output from fig2dev was standard output, bitmap export formats
	  failed because of bad argument to ghostscript
	o -P option description for PostScript removed from fig2dev man pages
	o Error parsing certain color specs for XPM files
	o Tightly curved, wide splines were sometimes "spikey"
	o Bounding box wasn't taking arrowhead width(s) into account
	o free_text now uses free() instead of less standard cfree()
	o Changed last references to sys_errlist to use strerror()
	o Bug in referencing imported xbm files in tk driver fixed
	o Temporary file not closed before deleting in read_gif() and read_ppm()
	o Formatting "%lf" in printf calls should be "%f"
	o Prepended $(DESTDIR) to $(XFIGLIBDIR) and $(FIG2DEV_DIR) directory
	  variables in Imakefile to be portable
	o Cleaned up extraneous and erroneous rules in fig2dev/Imakefile
	  from Pierre Humblet (Pierre.Humblet@eurecom.fr)
	o Removed calls to external programs "cat" and "ps2pdf" to make more
	  portable to Cygwin environment
	o fig2dev now uses gunzip instead of uncompress to uncompress .Z files
	  to be more portable for Cygwin environment
	o Papersize sometimes truncated when reading Fig file (e.g. would get
	  "Lette" instead of "Letter")

----------------------------
Patchlevel 3  (Jan 14, 2000)
[N.B. There was no transfig/fig2dev 3.2 patchlevel 2]

NEW FEATURES
	o Adapted the transfig manual from LaTeX 2.09 to LaTeX 2e and uses
	  Times/Helvetica/Courier instead of Computer Modern fonts.
	  From Roland Rosenfeld (roland@spinnaker.de)
	o If DBM file for RGB databse does not exist, read "rgb.txt" instead.
	o If a file such as /usr/local/lib/fig2dev/A3.ps exists, insert it
	  when generating PostScript output to select paper tray, for example.
	o Messages from bitmap output (GIF, JPEG, etc) are captured and printed
	  if there is any error during the export
	o New PDF driver (uses ps2pdf from the ghostscript distribution)
	o New CGM driver (Computer Graphics Metafile) from Philippe Bekaert
	  (Philippe.Bekaert@cs.kuleuven.ac.be)
	o More page sizes (Japanese JIS B0-B10 and ISO A0-A9)
	o Autocad Slide format called "sld" now instead of "acad"
	  (e.g. fig2dev -L sld ...)
	o -L eps is required for Encapsulated PostScript now, instead of fig2dev
	  just using the -P (add showpage) option to distinguish EPS from PS
	o The compile-time symbol EPSF in fig2dev/Imakefile has been changed:
	  comment out the DDLATEX2E_GRAPHICS = ... line if you don't want to use
	  the standard graphics package distributed w/ LaTeX2e
	  Uncomment the DDEPSFIG = ... line if you want to use the deprecated
	  epsfig macros distributed w/ LaTeX2e (DDLATEX2E_GRAPHICS must also be
	  defined)
	o The default is now to compile for DVIPS
	o Arc-boxes available for LaTeX now
	  from C. Scott Ananian <cananian@lesser-magoo.lcs.mit.edu>
	o New import picture formats supported - TIFF and PPM

BUGS FIXED
	o clipping and background filling incorrect for some Postscript/EPS
	  output
	o pstex driver now uses EPS driver for figure part instead of PostScript
	  for proper bounding box and orientation (this is what caused rotation
	  of the figure relative to the LaTeX text part when the Fig file spec-
	  ified Landscape)
	o TransFig now takes -L eps for Encapsulated PostScript language
	o Imported EPS file bounding box wasn't read correctly
	o readjpg.c and readjpg.o included in fig2dev/dev/Imakefile even without
	  JPEG support
	o calloc() declaration wrong for some systems (fig2dev/read.c)
	o Bug in importing EPS files - strange aspect ratios resulted
	o Used "True" and "False" instead of "TRUE" and "FALSE" in several
	  driver files.  Have converted all TRUE to True and FALSE to False
	o Some applications don't set clipping path when they import EPSF file,
	  and not only the background of the figure but whole paper may be
	  painted with the -g (background) option.
	o BitmapSuccess and BitmapFileInvalid were not defined in
	  fig2dev/dev/genxbm.c
	o Digital's compiler doesn't like "{ }" as initializer (genps.c)
	o Declarations of malloc() and calloc() removed from alloc.h, as they
	  are declared in <stdlib.h>
	o Arrowheads didn't quite extend far enough
	o Extra parenthesis in shell script when exporting to SLD, XBM, and XPM
	o splines were interpolated slightly differently than in xfig
	o Add description about "-j" option to help message (when I18N is enabled)
	o if imported PCX image file couldn't be opened, fig2dev tried to close
	  the file, which is a bad thing
	o %%EndProlog has been removed since it was not needed and there was
	  never a %%BeginProlog
	o needed pi.h for gentk.c (tk driver)
	o bzero macro defined globally now (wasn't defined in readpcx.c) for
	  those systems which don't have it (it is defined to use memset)
	o didn't include "pi.h" in dev/gentk.c for machines that don't have M_PI
	o Moved JPEGLIBDIR and JPEGINCDIR definition closer to the top in the
	  fig2dev/Imakefile
	o Output to GIF, JPEG, etc. (bitmap formats) didn't work properly if the
	  destination was stdout
	o "make install" changed because some systems' install program can only
	   take one file at a time
	o Added a "newpath" command after the initial clip command for PostScript
	  output just in case an object is drawn without a preceding newpath
	o M_2PI was redefined without first being #undef'd
	o the "-" character in Fig files should really be a hyphen, not a dash as
	  it was encoded for PostScript output.  This is fixed thanks to info
	  from Robert Maier.
	o Splines didn't come out exactly as they did in xfig.
	o In transfig, character used instead of int when checking for EOF on
	  file. From Geoff Keating (geoffk@ozemail.com.au)
	o %%EndDocument only written for imported EPS files (not XPM, etc)
	  From Dick Wesseling (ftu@fi.UU.nl)
	o Added "if defined(FreeBSDArchitecture)" to include -lcompat library
	o Changed fig2dev.h to always include <sys/param.h>
	o Bounding box variables were uninitialized
	o Cleaned up error reporting of line numbers in Fig file
	o Text bounding calculations ignored the "include" directive for center-
	  and right-justified text, which is used to flag whether text should be
	  included in the bounding area.  This would affect the LaTeX, PicTex,
	  PSTeX, TexTyl, and IBMGL drivers.
	  From Anton Wilder <a.j.wilder@swansea.ac.uk>
	o Clipping for arrowheads so that thick lines wouldn't "protrude" through
	  the arrow tip modified so that it works properly with ghostscript 5.50.
	o Allocation error in reading some pcx files

----------------------------
Patchlevel 1  (July 1, 1998)

NEW FEATURES
	o New driver for tk (tcl/tk) - Generates canvas objects and canvas.
	  from Mike Markowski (mm@udel.edu)
	o -h option to print all options for all output languages
	o Japanese text support for LaTeX output
	  from T. Sato (VEF00200@niftyserve.or.jp)

BUGS FIXED
	o XPMLIB renamed to XPMLIBS in Imakefile because of conflict with
	  XFree86 variable name in xmkmf config files
	o Fixed bug in JPEGINCDIR path when relative path is used (when
	  USEINSTALLEDJPEG is *not* used) - the dev directory is one level
	  deeper so "../" is prepended for that case
	o The rest of the scaling problems for latex fixed :-)
	  from Hans Werner Strube (strube@physik3.gwdg.de)
	o Two bugs fixed in eepic driver
		1) -l option didn't work because DPI was 0 when line width was
		   defined
		2) -W option produced 0 line widths because of a bad fprintf
	o Dash length incorrect by factor of 80 for LaTeX output
	o I18N support added for LaTeX output
	o Incorrect amount of memory allocated for reading eps pictures
	o Bug in provided strstr() (only used if you've uncommented
	  #define NOSTRSTR in the Imakefile)
	o Fixed M_PI incompatibility with RedHat 5.0
	o moved convert_names procedure from readxpm.c into genps.c since only
	  genps.c needs it.  Removed readxpm.c as a result.
	o added missing PCX import driver
	o metric scaling for latex part fixed
	  From Martin Pahl <pahl@tnt.uni-hannover.de>
	o Some Linuxes need -lgdbm instead of -ldbm (fig2dev/Imakefile)
	o transparent color for GIF was not passed (new option -t)
	o multiple co-incident points in splines caused problems on some
	  machines (this patch was in the old spline model but failed to make
	  it to the X-Spline model)
	o endpoints of splines were missing sometimes
	o new #ifdef for glibc which already has sys_errlist defined
	o conflict with definition M_PI (3.14159....) on RedHat systems fixed
	o "Ledger" paper size removed from list of paper sizes.  It is really
	  "Tabloid" size in landscape mode.
	o arrowheads were too far back from end of line
	o dash length for lines were too large in LaTeX output
	o fig2dev can now be used in a pipe (e.g. cat x.fig | fig2dev -L ps ...)
	  was attempting to rewind file before
	o error in I18N defines in fig2dev/Imakefile
	o bug fixes and modernization of Metafont driver by Mats Bengtsson
	  <mats.bengtsson@s3.kth.se>
	o removed stricmp() function in dev/genepic.c because strcasecmp() is
	  equivalent
	o newpath command given in PostScript output after imported EPS pic to
	  prevent bounding box being drawn

===============================================================================
Version 3.2 (first release Aug 22, 1997)
===============================================================================

NEW FEATURES
	o flag in transfig/Imakefile to use "\usepackage" for LaTeX2e instead of
	  "\documentstyle" for LaTeX209.  See README file.
	o fig2dev now handles the bitmap formats (GIF, JPEG etc) instead of xfig,
	  so there is more consistent output. Requires the (free) netpbm package.
	  See the README file.
	o tiff (no compression) and AutoCad (acad) output languages added
	o image quality (0-100) is selectable for JPEG export (-q option)
	o PNG export driver added

BUGS FIXED
	o changed XPM variables to default X include/library in fig2dev/Imakefile
	o remove PageSize comment if EPS (no showpage)
	o bug in colormap for imported grayscale JPEG files
	o "rs gr" sequence after imported eps file changed to "restore grestore"
	  in case imported eps file had defined either "rs" or "gr"
	o There was a bug in the EPIC driver when drawing backward arrows - in
	  several places in genepic.c draw_arrow_head is called with unconverted
	  coordinates, which leads to totally displaced arrows.
	  from Heiko Schroeder (heiko@linux.local.de)
	o cleanup of dictionary wrapped around imported EPS files
	  from Franz Koch (franz.koch@zdv.uni-tuebingen.de)
	o pic output didn't produce dashed or dotted arc
	o metric flag incorrectly parsed
	o strcasecmp and strncasecmp bugs (s2 != '\0' and s2 == '\0' should
	  be *s2 ...)
	o error in JPEGINCDIR in fig2dev/Imakefile
	o rec_array wasn't being freed in gendev_objects (fig2dev.c)
	o thicklines not being set properly for LaTeX output
	o two-point splines looped infinitely on some machines
	  fixed by Jeff Dairiki <dairiki@kalman.apl.washington.edu>
	o arrowheads weren't correct on tight arcs in eepic output
	  fixed by Wolfgang Reissenberger <reissenb@veilchen.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de>
	o TransFig now uses \usepackage instead of \documentstyle, which is old
	  From Klaus Georg Barthelmann (barthel@Informatik.Uni-Mainz.DE)
	o fill pattern of rotated ellipses was rotated itself
	o Ledger/Tabloid sizes reversed (Tabloid is 11x17", Ledger is 17x11")
	o bounding box of text more accurate for text with/without descenders
	o added USEINLINE variable in Imakefile to use compiler inline functions
	o removed ANSI prototypes from spline routines in trans_spline.c

------------------------------
Version 3.2 Beta (Jan 9, 1997)
------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

o multi-page, paper size, magnification and transparent color stored in Fig
	file now.  (transparent color is only used by xfig when exporting
	to GIF format)
o comment that Redhat Linux users may have to change DBMLIB to -ldb in
	fig2dev/Imakefile
o figures in landscape are only rotated when showpage command is NOT used
	(-P).  This is because it doesn't need to be rotated for EPS,
o previous spline models (interpolated splines and approximated splines) are
  replaced by one single model (x-splines) which allows the user to mix
  interpolated and approximated control points (see the "FORMAT3.2" file
  from the "xfig" package for details).

BUGS FIXED

o added second % to %%BeginDocument and %%EndDocument
o garbage values for arrowhead produced when last two points in line were at
	same coordinate
o bug in reading multi-line text object
o showpage now follows restore as per standard
	from Christopher R. Wren (chris@wren.cambridge.ma.us)

===============================================================================
Version 3.1
===============================================================================
Patchlevel 2a (Jun 4, 1996)

NEW FEATURES

o only need to change XPM defines in fig2dev/Imakefile
o if your system has the strerror() function (doesn't have sys_errlist) then
	comment out NEED_STRERROR with an XCOMM comment.
o new option for PostScript output, "-e" to force figure to edge (flush-left).
	Useful when the figure was saved with Centering on.
o point objects (POLYLINE with only one point) have thickness now and will be
	filled circles if cap style is rounded.  PostScript output only.
o -A option to scale arrowhead sizes for epic driver
o can rotate all text (not just left justified) in LaTeX now using \rotatebox.
	The old restriction is not needed because the epsfig package is
	required to include ps_tex_t files anyway.
o new line types - Dash-dot (_.) Dash-dot-dot (_..) and Dash-dot-dot-dot (_...)
o new paper sizes: "Tabloid", "Ledger", "B", "C", "D", "E", "A0", "A1", "A2",
	"A3", "A4" and "B5".  See man fig2dev (-z option) for sizes in
	inches and cm

BUGS FIXED

o double colon (::) needed for .man installation in Imakefiles
o linewidth wasn't working correctly in epic/eepic driver
	from Andre Eickler (eickler@db.fmi.uni-passau.de)
o some versions of imake don't like null parameters in SpecialObjectRule in
	Imakefile - changed to "NullParameter"
o the text alignment problem in LaTeX output has been fixed (genlatex.c)
	From Francky Leyn (Francky.Leyn@esat.kuleuven.ac.be)
o if the endpoints of a POLYLINE are coincident, the line join parameter will
	be used to join them (xfig already showed this behavior)
o redefined $(XPMINCDIR) to $(XPMINC) because some compilers have trouble with
	header search path with empty "-I"
o incorrect directory specified for xpm.h in fig2dev/dev/genps.c and readxpm.c
o changed "ln -s" commands in Imakefiles to "-ln -s" so make will continue if
	symlinks are already in place
o back arrows incorrect for splines and lines in epic driver
o figure was clipped to pagesize even in EPS mode
o if paper size specified as "Ledger" in landscape mode fig2dev switches to
	"Tabloid" paper size and vice versa (Tabloid in portrait mode switches
	to Ledger)
o segfault when importing jpeg picture with grayscale colormap fixed
o colormap must be saved before jpeg_finish_decompress or
	jpeg_destroy_decompress are called in read_JPEG_file()
o #include <jpeglib.h> changed to #include "jpeglib.h" to ensure corrrect path
	used to find header file
o moved %Magnification information in PostScript output after %%BoundingBox
	(caused problems for some programs interpreting DSC PostScript)
o incorrect spline line thickness when multiple splines are used
o arrowheads caused DOMAIN error for asin on very small arcs
o include ctype.h in fig2dev.h for isascii() and isxdigit() macros
o removed redundant #ifdef NOSTRSTR from strstr.c because that file is only
	compiled if system has no strstr()
o error when using first user-defined color (color 32)
o fabs(), sin(), cos(), atan() and acos() redefined in genlatex.c, genpictex.c,
	genpstex.c and gentextyl.c
o error message about being unable to open eps file was mis-formatted
o multiple whitespace following "(atend)" in EPS file parsed correctly now
	from T. Sato (VEF00200@niftyserve.or.jp)
o extraneous variable in fprintf in genps.c
	from T. Sato
o extraneous % in fprintf in genepic.c (set_pattern)
o multi-page option shifted all pages incorrectly
o error in scanf format string for reading text from old (Fig 1.3) files
	from T. Sato
o error in fprintf format string for virtual font in gentpic driver
	from T. Sato
o erroneous "extern" declarations for cur_capstyle and cur_joinstyle in two
	dev/genps.c functions
o bug in skip_comment() which prevented some machines from seeing the end of
	file, giving erroneous "Incorrect format" error

---------------------------
Patchlevel 2 (Aug 16, 1995)

New Features:

o JPEG (JFIF) pictures objects supported for PostScript output
o %Magnification: comment added to PostScript output showing magnification
o the points of arrow heads don't protrude past the endpoints of the object

Bugs Fixed:

o the radius of arc-box corners is limited to the half of the smaller of the
	two sides of the box to avoid PostScript errors
o pstex driver incorrectly omitted postscript text in pstex output
o set_linewidth was passed double instead of int from fdraw_arrow_head
	in genepic.c
o length of dotted line dots too small for high resolution printers
o recursion bug fixed where run-time would increase exponentially with nesting
	of compound objects
o %%BeginDocument:/EndDocument now surrounds imported EPS files
o open arrowheads on arcs were overwritten by arc lines
o bug in pattern fill code which made patterns appear solid black when
	using dvips
	Thanks to Tomas Rokicki (rokicki@CS.Stanford.EDU) for finding the fix
o line thickness wasn't adjusted for new resolution in epic, eepic, pic, tpic
	and pictex drivers
o dash length incorrect for Fig 3.x files in pic and pictex drivers
o -s option to fix text pointsize wasn't being honored
o documentation typo with regard to rigid text.  Rigid text means that the font
	size doesn't change when text is inside a compound object and that
	object is scaled in xfig.  Not used for fig2dev.
o certain machines don't handle atan2(y,0.0) so arcs with endpoints having the
	same x value were incorrectly calculated
o some machines don't calculate hypot(x,y) correctly so changed to sqrt(x*x+y*y)
	in arc_bound()
o bug in calculating BoundingBox for PostScript in compound objects
o cleared up confusion about -DNFSS and -DEPSF.  Here is the final word:

  Add -DNFSS to DEFINES list to use NFSS2 font selection for LaTeX texts
  Add -DEPSF to DEFINES list to use epsfig macros as distributed w/ LaTeX2e

 	Hint: Users of LaTeX2e will probably want to include both of these
 	options; users of LaTeX 2.09 will probably want to include neither.

o new tints added (fill values 21-40) and arrowhead types for epic driver
     from Andre Eickler (eickler@db.fmi.uni-passau.de)
o pattern fill seg faulted for epic/eepic output (only PostScript has patterns)
o sanity check for font number
o font name "Modern" changed to more correct "Sans Serif" in documentation
o MetaFont driver only sent output to stdout
o version information (fig2dev -V) said "TransFig" instead of "fig2dev"
o getopt.c not needed for Solaris - #if (defined(...)) added in Imakefile
	for this
o removed duplicate #define of FALSE, TRUE and DEFAULT_FONT_SIZE in various
	drivers

---------------------------
Patchlevel 1 (Jan 24, 1995)

Bugs Fixed:

o eps files with binary data (!) now handled correctly
o -f option to PostScript driver with unknown PostScript font name caused
	seg fault
o increased resolution of unitlength specifier in latex/epic drivers - was
	rounding 0.00083333 to 0.0008.
o dash length not set correctly for epic driver
o area fill values incorrectly interpreted for some drivers other than
	PostScript - this also made fig2dev outpus spurious %s%s(%d%d)}
	for epic/eepic
o linejoin set instead of linecap in postscript output
o sets linecap to ROUND for ellipses and closed splines with dotted lines
o defines showpage as null for included EPS files instead of removing the
	word "showpage" from them
o definition for XCOMM in Imakefiles for those running R4
o bug in freeing xpm image structure incompatible pointer type
o bug in fig2dev/Imakefile variable for including -ldbm explicitly
o removed -lnsl option from fig2dev/dev/Imakefile - imake files should
	automatically add this to the Makefile for Solaris (SVR4) systems
o note added to README that you must do "make" before "make install"
o bug in reading text for linux os - text size was set to 0
o bcopy changed to memcpy call in dev/readpics.c
o SVR4 condition added to transfig/transfig.h for including string.h
o variable in fig2dev/Imakefile and fig2dev/dev/Imakefile for include
	directory for xpm files if your xpm headers are not in the default X11
	include directory

--------------------------
Patchlevel 0 (Jan 9, 1995)

o NOTE:	An error in xfig version 3.0.0 incorrectly positioned objects on the
	canvas when reading older fig files.  New objects entered with 3.0 are
	correctly positioned.
	I apologize for the inconvenience.
*****	This is the only reason why the file protocol number has changed.

Bugs Fixed:

o error when figure was larger or partially off the page and user did not
	select multipage option (-M)
o newline() declared twice (inconsistently) in dev/gentpic.c
o errors in read.c for linux machines - caused font size 0
o Linux machines need LOCAL_LDFLAGS = -ldbm in fig2dev/Imakefile
o sys/types.h needed in dev/readpics.c for BSD machines

===============================================================================
Version 3.0
===============================================================================
Transfig version 3.0.0 (Dec 22, 1994)

New Features:

o MetaFont driver added (from fig2mf)
	from Anthony Starks (ajs@merck.com)
o "-n name" option to specify filename for PostScript Title (e.g. when using
	stdin)
o -x <offset> and -y <offset> options for PostScript output to shift figure on
	page.
o fig2dev/dev/Imakefile settings to:
     1. Use LaTeX2e commands for setting fonts. As LaTeX2e will become the
	official release by spring this year (we redefined the start of
	spring to be the date the LaTeX is released). This is a subtle
	problem in the outcome of transfig, but some old font changing
	commands behave differnet now.
     2. To use the \epsfig-package distributed with LaTeX2e instead
	of \special{psfile... for included PS-figures.
   They use two new defines in the dev/Imakefile: -DNFSS for 1., -DEPSF for 2.
   From Hendrik G. Seliger (hank@blimp.automat.uni-essen.de)
o arrow heads are pointed now for PostScript (they were blunt before)
o EPS Objects have been generalized to Picture Objects. Currently EPS, XBM
	XPM (X11 color pixmap) and GIF formats are recognized.
	Compressed (.Z) and gzipped (.z or .gz) files are also handled.
o new command-line option '-z' for PostScript output used to select a paper
	size from the list of A4, B5, Letter, Legal.
	from Jon Roma (roma@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu)
o change to the pstex driver so that when it sees text with a LaTeX font it
	handles it using the LaTeX text object routine, but not treating it
	as "special" text. This allows the pstex driver to take the "hint"
	the since the user is using LaTeX font specifiers, those should be
	used. The only people who could be adversely affected by the change
	would be those using LaTeX font names as convenient synonyms for
	PS font names who would now get LaTeX fonts instead. Probably not
	a problem.
	from Micah Beck (beck@cs.utk.ecu)
o fig2ps2tex.sh for systems which don't have csh or dc.  Uses bc and awk.
	from Dave Raymond (raymond@kestrel.nmt.edu)


o changes to the file format (protocol).  See *xfig* Doc/FORMAT3.0 for details.
	Transfig will still read older Fig file formats.
Here are the features involving change to the protocol:
   o portrait/landscape, justification (center or flush left) and metric/inches
	indicators saved with figure file so is not necessary to supply the
	command-line args to specify them.  However they will override the file
	specification if given.
   o separate border and fill colors.
   o resolution is increased from 80 ppi to 1200 ppi.  This decreases jaggies.
	A side effect is that fig2dev can now read Fig files of any resolution.
   o there are now 32 colors - new ones are: gold, three shades each of blue,
	green, cyan, red, magenta, brown and pink.
   o in addition, there are now user-definable colors which are stored in the
	figure file as pseudo-objects of type 0 which define the rgb values
	in hexadecimal.  The color numbers range from 32 to 543 for a maximum
	of 512 user-defined colors.
   o more fill options - colors transition from black to full saturation
	(shades) and on to full white (tints, i.e. pastels).
	Or you can use one of 16 fill patterns - diagonal lines, bricks,
	shingles, crosshatch etc.
   o three line-join styles: miter (current style), round and bevel (see
	PostScript or Xlib reference for description)
   o three line-cap styles: butt (current style), round and projecting (see
	PostScript or Xlib reference for description)

Bugs fixed:

o circles/ellipses paths weren't being closed in postscript output - gap closed
o "%%Page: 1 1" added for single-page output for Document Structuring Compliancy
	(previously, Page: comment only appeared in multi-page figures)
o coord_system was declared extern in fig2dev/fig2dev.h.  This was incorrect.
o even/odd rule fill now used for filled objects as per xfig (PostScript)
o typo in fig2dev/dev/Imakefile said include -DA4d instead of -DA4 for A4 paper
o all orientations of rotated/flipped EPS objects correctly done now
o man pages for transfig claims to be able to read postscript files - this was
	never finished so it has been removed from the man pages.
o dotted lines with very small length caused SIGFPE
o typo in error message about unknown option
o added check for #if defined(SVR4) in addition to defined(SYSV)
o misplaced ';' in fig2dev.c gendev_null() proc
o added static declarations in genlatex.c genpictex.c and gentextyl.c
o better bounding box calculation
	from Uwe Bonnes (bon@lte.e-technik.uni-erlangen.de)
o Tpic TeX font position 5 was "sl" (slanted) which doesn't exist
	from Edward Wang (edward@cs.berkeley.edu)

===============================================================================
Version 2.1
===============================================================================

Transfig version 2.1.8 (Oct 1, 1993)

New Features:

Bugs fixed:

o thick line threshold increased from 1 to 2 for latex lines
o save/restore wraps EPS objects now
o specifing nonexistant font with -f caused coredump
	from Gordon W. Ross (gwr@jericho.mc.com)
o newpath command given before EPS object for PostScript output
o moved definition of SetFigFont to better place
	from Bernd Raichle (raichle@isr.uni-stuttgart.de)
o #included sys/types for BSD4_3 systems in genps.c
o bug in eepic output - SetFigFont was being defined inside a \put
	from Vivek Khera (khera@cs.duke.edu)
o BoundingBox for EPS objects can be floating values
o shortened file name (fig2dev/dev/)def_setfigfont.c to setfigfont.c
o distribution version of fig2dev/dev/Makefile had (def_)setfigfont.c
	instead of (def_)setfigfont.o in LIBOBJS definition
o SUBDIR fig2dev/dev was missing from top-level Imakefile caused problems
	where make would say something like "No rule to make target
	dev/libtransfig.a"

----------------------
Transfig version 2.1.7

o no longer writes over input file if there is an error in the command line
o added "%%Orientation: Landscape" comment for PostScript output in landscape
	orientation
o moved definition of SetFigFont from transfig into genpstex.c so that there
	is no need to run transfig for pstex output
o script pic2tpic was generating \ss instead of \sf for \fH
	from Mark Roth (mroth@afit.af.mil)
o changed header for Encapsulated postscript files from "%!PS-Adobe-2.0 EPSF"
	to "%!PS-Adobe-2.0 EPSF-2.0" which allows FrameMaker and ghostview to
	read them properly.
	from Vivek Khera (khera@cs.duke.edu)
o check for #ifdef SYSV to include string.h instead of strings.h in
	fig2dev/dev/genibmgl.c
o changed EXTRA_LIBRARIES to SYS_LIBRARIES in fig2dev/Imakefile so wouldn't
	clobber system-dependent flags in EXTRA_LIBRARIES
o fprintf and 'else' missing from genepic which caused incorrect information
	to be generated when drawing arcs using epic output
o removed dependencies on the X libraries (Imakefiles and Makefiles)
o SGI machines had trouble with hypot() which caused arrow heads to mess up
	from Malcolm Davis (davis@nod.bms.com)
o Flipped EPS objects were incorrectly flipped on output
	from Brian Boyter (boyter@pyrdc.va.pyramid.com)
o POLYLINES were being drawn in sections (10 points per section) which
	resulted in incorrect dashed line lengths and only one section
	filled if area fill was on
	from Peter Egelberg (egel@neural.se)
o added Sequent machines and Suns with SunOs < 4.1 to list of machines that
	don't have strstr()
	from Scott Erikson (sources@ics.uci.edu)
o removed PATCHLEVEL from patchlevel.h file - version number is complete with
	three parts (e.g. 2.1.6)
o removed "extern coord_system" from fig2dev.h (wasn't used by fig2dev)
o SPECIAL_CHAR split into three strings for systems which can't handle one
o -P flag dissappeared from eepic output language - reinstated

-------------
Version 2.1.6

o Courier-BoldItalic changed to Courier-BoldOblique for PostScript fonts
o "if" statement replaces copysign() call since some machines don't have it
o some backslashes ('\') corrected in printf statements in transfig/mkfile.c and
	fig2dev/iso2tex.c
o changed header for postscript files from "%!" to "%!PS-Adobe-2.0" when using
	-P (showpage) option and "%!PS-Adobe-2.0 EPSF" otherwise (Encapsulated)
o corrupt transfig/Imakefile and typo (SCRS instead of SRCS)
o some variables (cur_thickness and coord_system) were multiply defined in
	various drivers in fig2dev/dev - made those static
